# Python-CarSalesPerson
 This python code takes a Car Sale person program where the user enters the base price of a car. The program should add on a bunch of extra fees such as tax, license, dealer prep, and destination charge.  Make tax and license a percent of the base price. The other fees should be set values. Display the actual price of the car once all the extras are applied.  CSCI 1511 introduces basic concepts of game design and programming. I learnt the Python programming language constructs to write programs that integrate classes, class methods, and class instances, built upon basic structures such as: input method handling, 2D sprite manipulation and animation, collision detection, game physics and basic artificial intelligence.
